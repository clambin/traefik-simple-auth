// has a valid session (stored in a http.Cookie). If so, it returns http.StatusOK.   If not, it redirects the requesr
// to the configured oauth provider to log in.  After login, the request is routed to the AuthCallbackHandler, which
// forwards the request to the originally requested destination.

		// the callback may be routed to a different instance than the one that generate the state.
